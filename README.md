# Scalable-Microservices-with-Full-DevOps-Lifecycle-AWS-Kubernetes-Terraform-
Production-grade microservice demo application deployed on AWS using Kubernetes (EKS), automated with Terraform and CI/CD pipelines. Includes monitoring, logging, and security best practices.
Key highlights:

🐳 Microservices Architecture – containerized services (frontend, cart, catalogue, orders, etc.)

🌐 Infrastructure as Code (IaC) – AWS VPC, EKS cluster, RDS, and load balancer provisioned using Terraform

⚙️ CI/CD Pipelines – GitHub Actions workflows for automated build, test, Docker image push (ECR), and Kubernetes deployment

☸️ Container Orchestration – Kubernetes manifests with Ingress, HPA, and secrets management

📊 Monitoring & Logging – Prometheus + Grafana dashboards, Loki for centralized logs, and alerting rules

🔐 Security – IAM roles, TLS/HTTPS, and secret management using AWS Secrets Manager / External Secrets Operator

📖 Documentation – architecture diagrams, pipeline flow, deployment instructions, and dashboards

Learning Outcomes:

Automating infrastructure provisioning with Terraform

Designing Git branching strategies and PR workflows

Building secure and reliable CI/CD pipelines

Deploying scalable microservices with Kubernetes

Implementing observability with monitoring & logging stacks

Applying security best practices across the delivery pipeline
